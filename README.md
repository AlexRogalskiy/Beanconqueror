# Beanconqueror
## Getting the App
The App is basically a Website. (Don't run away yet, it's smooth as hell !)  
To get it up and running on your system check below:
### Android
Download a Release [here](https://github.com/graphefruit/Beanconqueror/releases).  
Later on you might be able to get the app through the Playstore check. (Check back [here](https://github.com/graphefruit/Beanconqueror/issues/3))
### iOS
Building an iOS app is pretty darn expensive, so unless someone volunteers it's not going to happen.
You can still use the App though, through the PWA. Check *Getting The App / Anything Else*.
### Anything else
The App ist available with any modern internet browser at (link will be added soon (tm)).  
If your system is up for it you can load Beanconqueror as a PWA for a sweet offline experience.
